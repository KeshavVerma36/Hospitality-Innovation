                    <p>
                        The key offering of Summits organized by GBB are the pre-arranged, diligently curated B2B
                        meetings scheduled for the delegates and suppliers. The invited delegates are pre-qualified
                        based on a number of criteria including the projects represented, size of these projects, their
                        decision-making capacity and the budgets to source. They then provide their project requirements
                        which is carefully matched with the offerings of the renowned global suppliers attending the
                        summit. This robust process ensures high-quality business matches, based on which the
                        face-to-face meetings are organized with the help of dedicated account managers at the summit.
                        Every meeting therefore is sure to be productive while leaving each attendee with long-term and
                        valuable business network.
